ImageGrabber is a simple, .Net-based image downloader.  Given one or more URLs,
it retrieves the specified page(s), extracts all image links, and downloads
each linked image into the current directory.

This is not an image scraper, per se, since it doesn't download the images
contained within a page, but rather the images to which the page links.

Since this was written as an exercise in C#, all references and function
calls are explicit.  There are no 'using' statements.
